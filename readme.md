# Cneurons

- Easy starter for starters in **Perceptron neural networks** in **C for embedded systems**, the smaller controllers.
- Concept of Cneurons is to **train in Python** and **implement in embedded C**.
- Using Cneurons is by copying an example, currently one, from the example directory. Then, run the python script, next, run the C application. The **Python example exports the perceptron parameters** as a result of the training into corresponding files for the C application.
- Extend the example to your needs.

First a philosophic note, if you don't want that, scroll down to the example(s).

# Important to understand

The highest form of intelligence is to apply the **[scientific method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method)**, below that is **[artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence)**. Artificial intelligence was developed through the scientific method. The **preferable method** to solve a technological problem is, therefore, the **scientific method**.

The **scientific method generates a mathematically description of a behavior**. **Artificial intelligence assumes a mathematical relation between inputs and outputs** according the way you teach it. So, a neural network **cannot be more powerful than the mind by which it was trained**. There is no doubt, there are very powerful neural networks and concepts of artificial intelligence, even more powerful than my mind.

Important to know when dealing with neural networks is the following:

**Two equations that share more than two unknown variables, cannot be solved. Also not by a neural network.**

Or:

**Two equations that share more than two unknown variables, can be solved, however, having multiple solutions. Also in a neural network.**

It is very likely that you train a network by the latter concept due to suffering an overview in the data.

# Examples
## Detection of sound

Example: [Strings and organ](https://github.com/andriesbron/Cneurons/tree/master/examples/stringsandorgan)

Demonstrates a workflow for detecting sound using autocorrelation, in this case, strings in E from cathedral organ in A recorded in Garageband.
