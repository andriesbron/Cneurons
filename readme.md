# Cneurons

- Easy starter for starters in **Perceptron neural networks** in **C for embedded systems**, the smaller controllers.
- Concept of cNeurons is to **train in Python** and **implement in embedded C**.
- Using Cneurons is by copying an example, currently one, from the example directory. Then, run the python script, next, run the C application. The **Python example exports the perceptron parameters** as a result of the training into corresponding files for the C application.
- Extend the example to your needs.

First a philosophic note, if you don't want that, scroll down to the example(s).

# Important to understand

The highest form of intelligence is to apply the **scientific method**, below that is **artificial intelligence**. Artificial intelligence was developed through the scientific method. The **preferable method** to solve a technological problem is, therefore, the **scientific method**.

The **scientific method generates a mathematically description of a behavior**. **Artificial intelligence assumes a mathematical relation between inputs and outputs** according the way you teach it. So, a neural network **cannot be more powerful than the mind by which it was trained**. There is no doubt, there are very powerful neural networks and concepts of artificial intelligence.

The most important thing when starting with neural networks and artificial intelligence is this:

**Two equations that share more than two unknown variables, cannot be solved. Also not by a neural network.**

Or:

**Two equations that share more than two unknown variables, can be solved, however, having multiple solutions. Also in a neural network.**

It is very likely that you train a network by the latter concept due to suffering an overview in the data.

# Examples
## Detection of sound

Example: [Strings and organ](https://github.com/andriesbron/Cneurons/tree/master/examples/stringsandorgan)

Example demonstrates how to use autocorrelation for detecting a sound, in this case, A note strings or a E note cathedral organ recorded from Garageband, just to demonstrate the work process and that it apparently can work.
